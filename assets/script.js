// AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score


// function with add event listener for start button to start the quiz.
// need countdown timer to start with the quiz --- time left needs to be recorded as highscore 
// add time reduction function for incorrect answers
// make an array of objects(questions) with properties (1.correct answer, 2.array of possible answers 3.)
// store the questions and corresponding correct answers 
// add event listener for user answer selection so selection can be stored on the local storage
// creat a function to compare the user selection with the correct answer for that question
// use for loops to go through question and answer arrays
// stop the quiz once question array is complete or if the timer is === 0
// once the game is over user can save their score attached with their initials to be stored on the local storage.

// menu for highscore needs to link to a separate html 
// ---do the same for change of difficulty and bonus quiz

// personal objectives after criteria is met and if time permits
// make start button change to "Good Luck!" after click event
// add at least 2 additional question arrays for different difficulties easy med hard
// create new q/a arrays to incorporate HTML and CSS fundamentals
// make high score only include top 5 highest scores, add date stamp
