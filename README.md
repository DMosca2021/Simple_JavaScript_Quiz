# JavaScript Quiz Week 4 Homework

## Description
The goal of this homework was to showcase my knowledge of JavaScript functions, traversing the DOM, and using JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS. I used this knowledge to creat a simple multiple choice quiz with questions based on the fundamentals of JavaScript. I found this homework to be the most challenging part of the bootcamp thus far. I plan on revisiting this homework and updating it with more questions and features to help solidify my understanding of JavaScript. 

## Tasks Completed 
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question 
- WHEN I answer a question 
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score -- Currently not working

## Rules for the quiz.

Hit the start button. You will be presented with a multiple choice question. Answer to the best of your knowledge. You will be timed during the quiz and the remaining time when you complete your quiz will be your end score. For every question you answer incorrect you will be deducted 10 seconds until the correct answer is chosen or time runs out. At completion of the quiz your end score will be calculated and you will be able to store it for future benchmarking of your JavaScript knowledge.
